kadanes algrithm best example test use /// here we try to find the max subarray using the kadanes algoritm with the diffrence array and then whicever sum is larger we return that
kadane algorithm ///:-
use msf and meh;
for all elements in array
meh += a[i];
```
```
```
use msf and meh;
for all elements in array
meh += a[i]
if(meh<0)meh = 0;
msf = max(msf,meh);
